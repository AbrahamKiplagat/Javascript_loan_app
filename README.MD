Sure, here's a README.md file for the Emore Systems Mortgage Loan Calculator:

# Emore Systems Mortgage Loan Calculator

This is a simple mortgage loan calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input the loan amount, interest rate, and number of months to pay back the loan. The calculator then computes the monthly payment based on the provided inputs.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the desired loan amount in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh) into the "Loan Amount" input field.
3. Input the annual interest rate as a percentage in the "Interest Rate" input field.
4. Specify the number of months you want to repay the loan in the "Months to Pay" input field.
5. The monthly payment will be automatically calculated and displayed below the input fields.

## Limitations

- The calculator assumes a fixed interest rate throughout the loan period.
- The interest is calculated as simple interest, not compound interest.
- The results are rounded to two decimal places for simplicity.

## Compatibility

The Emore Systems Mortgage Loan Calculator is designed to work on modern web browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Please note that this calculator is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only. For accurate financial calculations and decisions, consult with a qualified financial advisor.
